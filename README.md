## About Me
I have a strong, often obsessive passion for solving interesting puzzles. Not so much jigsaw or lock puzzles, but technological ones - finding creative, often hacky ways of making things work, even when they really shouldn’t. Whether it’s a few (or many) clever lines of code, a dash (or monstrosity) of unusual configuration magic, a giant behemoth of interconnected components that work when you chant the secret words, and everything in between, I’m constantly seeking out new, intriguing scenarios just begging for a solution.

I spent years as a Security Engineer in the finance industry building an Identity Governance solution from the ground up, constantly working within forced limitations to just “make things work”, however I could. Now, as a Cybersecurity Solutions Architect, I leverage my experience to pursue my passion every day - designing and presenting powerful solutions to solve every use case thrown my way, for every type of organization imaginable. And the best part? I just solve the puzzles, and let others bring them to life.

`Occasionally, I write blog posts and create videos about the products I specialize in.`
